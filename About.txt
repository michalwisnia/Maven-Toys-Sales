I completed a Power BI project using a rich dataset from Maven Toys, a fictitious chain of small toy stores in Mexico. The dataset consisted of four CSV format tables - Products, Stores, Sales, and Inventory - and spanned over 800,000 sales transactions from January 2017 to October 2018.

What I Did:
To begin the project, I connected and cleaned the data, transforming queries to edit columns and add new useful ones, including calendar and category lookup tables. I also created table relationships and filter flows to streamline data analysis.

The visualisation consisted of four pages:

The main page displayed essential statistics and allowed for filtering by date period, location type, category, product, city, and store.
Page 2 showcased additional useful data, such as monthly profit/revenue, category trends by month, the impact of the day of the week, and stores/items out of stock.
Page 3 focused on a specific product, displaying monthly statistics versus target, price adjustments and their hypothetical impact on profits, and current stock.
Page 4 centered around a particular store, showcasing monthly statistics versus target, revenue, and current stock.
Insights:
The Power BI project yielded valuable insights into the Maven Toys dataset. For instance, Lego Bricks brought in the most revenue, but Colobricks was the most profitable product. However, its sales had been steadily declining over time, so it might be worth considering lowering the price. Additionally, Art&Craft was the most profitable category, even though it was the least popular at the beginning, while Electronics had become the least profitable category in recent times. Playfoam and Hot Wheels 5 pack were new products that generated significant sales and profits, but were only available in certain stores, so they needed to be stocked in larger amounts and in more locations. Finally, weekends were the most profitable days of the week, while Tuesdays were the least profitable.

Conclusion:
The Power BI project allowed me to apply my data exploration, analysis, and visualization skills to a real-world business scenario. I was able to create a user-friendly dashboard that not only highlighted key metrics but also provided actionable insights into Maven Toys' sales and inventory data.
